Hey there! I'm Karl-Henrik Nilsson but my friends call me KH. I'm your typical middle-aged tech nerd, currently based in sunny Dubai but originally from Sweden. My passion? Crafting software, tinkering with hardware, and diving deep into all things tech.

I've spent a fair share of my life speaking on stages around the globe, which, aside from giving me an amazing circle of friends, has somehow convinced me that people might actually enjoy hearing my stories. Crazy, right?

Speaking of stories, I absolutely love telling them! Whether it's to a crowded room at a conference or entertaining my daughter at bedtime. Here on this blog, I aim to share some of my favorites, like the time I accidentally became a public speaker or when I landed a programming job in a language I'd never even heard of!

Truth be told, I've had a few false starts in the blogging worldâ€”grand ideas that fizzled out or got forgotten. But this time, I'm keeping it simple and focusing on the content. Expect a mix of tech and life insights. Will it stick? Who knows! But hey, you're already reading the About page of some random guy's blog, so you might just be along for the ride!
