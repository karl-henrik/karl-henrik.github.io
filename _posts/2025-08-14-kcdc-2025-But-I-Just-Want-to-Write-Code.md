I had the pleasure of speaking at [**KCDC 2025**](https://www.kcdc.info/) on the topic: *“But I Just Want to Write Code... Career Advice for Satisfied Developers.”*

I wrote this talk for developers who enjoy coding and want to keep doing it—full-time. I wanted to show that this is not only a valid career choice, but one where you can thrive. I shared tips for staying valuable, demonstrating impact, and continuing to grow without feeling pressured into a management track. Judging by the laughs in the room and the many lovely words of feedback, I think you liked it. Thank you for that, dear audience ❤️

This was my first time speaking at KCDC, and I love the energy. The organizers, volunteers, and attendees make it a welcoming, engaging event. At the time of writing we are only at our first day and I have already met so many passionate people here in Kansas City!

Ill update this post with my second talk for KCDC after I have given it tomorrow and more on my KCDC experience.

If you’ve ever considered sharing your own experiences on stage, watch for next year’s call for papers and submit! And if you’re new to speaking and want help shaping your first talk, feel free to reach out. I’m always happy to help someone get started.
