Last Saturday, I had the pleasure of speaking at the **Global AI Bootcamp in Abu Dhabi** on the topic: *“AI Colleagues and Co-Pilots: Making the Most of Our New Teammates.”*

I am not an AI guy but as always, I have been curious and spent a lot of time learning! It was a lot of fun to share what I have learned from my experiments so far and even more so that everyone seemed to enjoy it so much ❤️ I really enjoyed meeting so many AI-curious minds who chose to spend their Saturday learning about and exploring AI.

I think some of the best insights I have gotten over the last months is how important it is to select the right model for the job such as writing strategy with a "thinking" model and implement using a code optimized model, not to mention how important it is to use the built in context files for GitHub Co-Pilot to make sure it works like I intended for the project.
