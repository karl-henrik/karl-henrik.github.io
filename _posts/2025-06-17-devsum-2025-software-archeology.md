Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking at [**DevSum 2025**](https://www.devsum.se/) on the topic: *“Software Archeology: Excavating Ancient Code in the Modern Enterprise.”*

I wrote this talk to reassure people, many teams have applications full of decisions that no longer make sense. Many projects also suffer from lack ownership and structure - and that's normal. My goal is for you to accept the past and begin treating your architecture like an archeological dig. If you are willing to get your hands dirty, you too can gain deep knowledge about your precious artifacts. 

DevSum often has a great lineup of speakers, and this year was no exception! I got to learn about my brain, ASP.NET Web APIs, microservices, RUST, AI agents, and perhaps the most shocking news of all: CSS now has if statements!!

I have spoken at DevSum many times and I love the culture at this event. From the amazing organizers, engaged audience to all the friends (❤️) that I have made there over the years, it has been a fantastic experience that keeps getting better. 

If you are keen on public speaking, keep an eye out for next year's call for papers and submit something! If you are new to speaking or want to give it a go but don't know where to start, feel free to reach out. I would love to help a new speaker take the stage!
