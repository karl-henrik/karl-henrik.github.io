The last conference of the year was [**Mobile Developers Week**](https://mobiledevelopersweek.com/), where I gave my talk: *"AI Colleagues and Co-Pilots: Making the Most of Our New Teammates."*

I had a great time with many lovely conversations. I am still new to the UAE community, and it feels great to meet more speakers and technology enthusiasts in the region. 

On Sunday it was my turn to take the stage, and I have to thank the lovely audience for both great participation and their fantastic feedback on my talk, especially those who said they were going straight home to implement some of my ideas. That's the best kind of feedback!

I quite like this talk, even though I am not an AI specialist, but as always, I've been curious and spent a lot of time learning! In this talk, I share what I've learned from my experiments with AI tools about how we can make the most of these new teammates in our daily development work, and why people have different experiences using AI, even when they are following the same patterns.  

Thanks to the organizers who brought people from a range of developer backgrounds together under one banner, I had a really nice time!
