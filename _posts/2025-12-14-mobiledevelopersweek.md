This weekend I am speaking at [**Mobile Developers Week**](https://mobiledevelopersweek.com/) on the topic: *"AI Colleagues and Co-Pilots: Making the Most of Our New Teammates."*

I attended yesterday's sessions on Saturday and had a great time with many lovely conversations, I am still new to the UAE community and it feels great to expand my network in the region. Today, Sunday the 14th of December, it's my turn to take the stage!

## What to Expect

I'm not an AI guy, but as always, I've been curious and spent a lot of time learning! In this talk, I'll share what I've learned from my experiments with AI tools about how we can make the most of these new teammates in our daily development work, and why people have different experiences using AI, even when they are following the same patterns.  

We'll explore topics like:

- Selecting the right AI model for different tasks
- Why iterating is so important when working with AI 
- Leveraging context files in GitHub Copilot to guide AI assistance
- Practical tips from real-world experimentation

If you're curious about AI tools and want to learn how to work more effectively with them, this talk is for you!
